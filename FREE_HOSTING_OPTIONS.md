   - Set up health check endpoints
   - Configure alerts for downtime

3. **Create restart mechanisms**
   - Configure automatic restarts on crash
   - Implement health check and recovery scripts
   - Set up external monitoring services

### Maximizing Uptime

1. **For serverless/scheduled deployments**
   - Overlap execution schedules
   - Implement proper session handoff
   - Use database for state management
   - Keep execution under platform limits

2. **For self-hosted solutions**
   - Configure power management settings
   - Set up UPS if possible
   - Implement automatic updates
   - Configure appropriate cooling

3. **For PaaS platforms with sleep**
   - Create external pinging service
   - Implement lightweight endpoints
   - Distribute functionality across services

## Conclusion

Free hosting options provide viable solutions for running your WhatsApp bot, though each comes with specific limitations. For most reliable free operation, Oracle Cloud Free Tier and repurposed hardware offer the best combination of resources and stability. For simpler bots, platforms like Render.com and Fly.io provide excellent no-cost options with minimal setup complexity.

The key to successful free hosting is understanding each platform's constraints and designing your bot architecture accordingly. By implementing the best practices outlined in this guide, you can achieve stable operation without incurring hosting costs.
