# Command Module Compatibility Guide for Heroku Deployment

## How Command Modules Work in Heroku Deployment

The Heroku deployment has been updated to fully support all the command modules from your existing WhatsApp bot. Here's how it works:

### Command Loading System

1. When the Heroku server starts:
   - The server initializes first
   - `initializeCommands()` loads all command modules from the `src/commands` directory
   - The WhatsApp connection is established

2. The command loading process:
   - Scans all subdirectories in `src/commands`
   - Loads each JavaScript file as a module
   - Organizes modules by category based on folder structure
   - Logs success/errors for each module loaded

### Command Handling

The `handleIncomingMessage()` function processes messages in this order:

1. Checks for built-in system commands (help, ping, status, uptime, modules)
2. If not a built-in command, looks for the command in all loaded modules
3. When found, executes the command with proper context
4. Provides detailed error handling if command execution fails

### Standard Command Module Format

Your command modules should follow this structure for compatibility:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // Module information
  info: {
    name: "Module Name",
    description: "Module description",
  },
  
  // Command handlers
  commands: {
    // Command name should match what users type after !
    commandName: async (context) => {
      // The context object contains:
      // - sender: the chat ID where the command was sent
      // - senderNumber: the sender's phone number
      // - isGroup: whether this is a group chat
      // - command: the command name
      // - args: array of command arguments
      // - sock: the WhatsApp socket
      // - safeSendMessage: helper function for safe message sending
      
      // Send a response message
      await context.safeSendMessage(context.sender, {
        text: "Your response here"
      });
    },
    
    // Additional commands...
  }
};
```

## Transferring Command Modules to Heroku

When deploying to Heroku, ensure your command modules are included:

1. Copy your entire `src/commands` directory structure
2. Ensure the deployment includes all module files
3. Any required assets should be in accessible directories

## Testing Modules After Deployment

After deploying to Heroku, you can verify your modules are loaded:

1. Check the Heroku logs for module loading messages
2. Send the `!modules` command to see all loaded modules
3. Test specific commands to ensure they work properly

## Error Handling

The Heroku deployment includes robust error handling:

1. Module loading errors are logged but don't crash the application
2. Command execution errors are caught and reported back to users
3. All errors are logged in the application stats and viewable in Heroku logs

## Advanced Topics

### Adding New Modules

1. Simply add new module files to the `src/commands` directory structure
2. Restart the Heroku dyno to load the new modules
3. No code changes to `heroku-bot.js` are needed

### Using External APIs

If your commands use external APIs:

1. Set API keys as Heroku environment variables:
   ```bash
   heroku config:set API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

2. Access them in your modules using `process.env.API_KEY`

### Handling Media and Files

For commands that handle media:

1. Store temporary files in a directory that's writable in Heroku
2. Clean up temporary files after sending
3. Consider using memory buffers instead of file system when possible

This module system maintains compatibility with your existing command structure while providing the reliability of Heroku hosting.
