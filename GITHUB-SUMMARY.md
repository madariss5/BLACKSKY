# BLACKSKY-MD WhatsApp Bot: GitHub Repository Updates

## What's New

This update adds multiple deployment methods for the WhatsApp bot, with a focus on solving common dependency issues and simplifying the deployment process:

### 1. Docker-based Deployment for Heroku

- Added `Dockerfile` with all necessary dependencies for canvas and other modules
- Created `heroku.yml` for container-based deployment
- Provided detailed `HEROKU-DOCKER-GUIDE.md` with step-by-step instructions

### 2. Aptfile-based Deployment for Heroku

- Added `aptfile` with system dependencies
- Created comprehensive `HEROKU-APTFILE-GUIDE.md`
- Uses Heroku's apt buildpack to resolve dependency issues

### 3. One-Click Deployment Button

- Added "Deploy to Heroku" button to README
- Created `app.json` for direct Heroku deployment
- Simplified configuration with environment variables

### 4. Environment Variable Authentication

- Added support for `CREDS_JSON` environment variable
- Allows credential management without file uploads
- Simplifies deployment workflow

### 5. Comprehensive Documentation

- Added `DEPLOYMENT_OPTIONS.md` summarizing all methods

2. **Simplified Deployment**: The one-click deployment button and environment variable authentication make it much easier to get started.

3. **Multiple Options**: Different deployment methods for different user preferences and technical requirements.
