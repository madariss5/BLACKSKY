# WhatsApp Bot Deployment Options

This document summarizes the various deployment options available for the WhatsApp bot.

## Overview

We've implemented multiple deployment strategies to accommodate different needs and address common issues when deploying a WhatsApp bot to cloud environments:

1. **Standard Heroku Deployment**
2. **Docker-based Heroku Deployment** 
3. **Aptfile-based Heroku Deployment**
4. **Environment Variable Authentication**

## Deployment Methods

### 1. Standard Heroku Deployment

**Best for**: Simple deployments without complex dependencies

```bash
# Create a Heroku app
heroku create your-whatsapp-bot-name

# Push to Heroku
git push heroku main
```

**Documentation**: See `HEROKU-DEPLOYMENT.md`

### 2. Docker-based Heroku Deployment

**Best for**: Resolving canvas/chart.js dependency issues

```bash
# Create a Heroku app
heroku create your-whatsapp-bot-name

# Set the stack to container
heroku stack:set container -a your-whatsapp-bot-name

# Push to Heroku
git push heroku main
```

**Documentation**: See `HEROKU-DOCKER-GUIDE.md`

### 3. Aptfile-based Heroku Deployment

**Best for**: Alternative approach to resolve dependency issues without Docker

```bash
# Create a Heroku app
heroku create your-whatsapp-bot-name

# Add buildpacks
heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 heroku-community/apt -a your-whatsapp-bot-name
heroku buildpacks:add --index 2 heroku/nodejs -a your-whatsapp-bot-name

# Push to Heroku
git push heroku main
```

**Documentation**: See `HEROKU-APTFILE-GUIDE.md`

### 4. Environment Variable Authentication

**Best for**: Simplest approach for credential management

```bash
# Set the credentials as an environment variable
heroku config:set CREDS_JSON='{"clientID":"your-content-here",...}' -a your-whatsapp-bot-name
```

## Authentication Methods

Because WhatsApp restricts connections from cloud platforms like Replit and Heroku (often returning error 405), we've implemented multiple authentication strategies:

1. **Local Authentication First**: Establish connection locally, then transfer credentials
2. **CREDS_JSON Environment Variable**: Store credentials directly in Heroku config
3. **Manual Credential Upload**: SSH into the dyno and upload credentials directly

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Connection Error 405 | Use the local authentication method first, then transfer credentials |
| Canvas dependency issues | Use either Docker or Aptfile approach |
| Heroku build failures | Check logs with `heroku builds:output` |
| Connection unstable | Increase `MAX_RETRIES` in heroku-bot.js |

## Decision Tree: Which Deployment Method to Use?

1. **Do you need canvas/chart.js functionality?**
   - Yes → Use Docker or Aptfile approach
   - No → Standard deployment is sufficient

2. **Do you prefer simpler setup or more control?**
   - Simpler setup → Use Aptfile approach
   - More control → Use Docker approach

3. **Are you concerned about memory usage?**
   - Yes → Standard or Aptfile approach (Docker images can be larger)
   - No → Any approach works

## Quick Start

For those who want to get started quickly, we recommend:

1. Use `local-connect.js` locally to establish authentication
2. Deploy to Heroku using the Aptfile approach
3. Set your credentials using the CREDS_JSON environment variable
