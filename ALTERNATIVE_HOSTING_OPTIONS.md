   - Create a workflow file (.github/workflows/bot.yml):
   ```yaml
   name: Run WhatsApp Bot
   on:
     workflow_dispatch:
     schedule:
       - cron: '*/10 * * * *'  # Run every 10 minutes
   
   jobs:
     keep-alive:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       timeout-minutes: 9  # Just under the 10-minute schedule
       
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         
         - name: Setup Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v3
           with:
             node-version: '20'
             
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: npm install
           
         - name: Setup session persistence
           run: |
             mkdir -p auth_info_baileys
             # Restore previous session from artifacts
             echo "${{ secrets.SESSION_DATA }}" | base64 -d > session_data.tar.gz
             tar -xzf session_data.tar.gz -C ./
             
         - name: Run bot
           run: node src/index.js &
           
         - name: Keep alive
           run: |
             sleep 8m  # Run for most of the allowed time
             # Save session for next run
             tar -czf session_data.tar.gz auth_info_baileys/
             echo "SESSION_DATA=$(base64 -w 0 session_data.tar.gz)" >> $GITHUB_ENV
             
         - name: Update session secret
           uses: gliech/create-github-secret-action@v1
           with:
             name: SESSION_DATA
             value: ${{ env.SESSION_DATA }}
             pa_token: ${{ secrets.GH_PA_TOKEN }}
   ```

3. **Set Up Required Secrets**:
   - Create a Personal Access Token with repo scope
   - Add it as a secret named `GH_PA_TOKEN`
   - Initialize an empty `SESSION_DATA` secret

### Advantages:
- Completely free (within GitHub Actions limits)
- No server management needed
- Automatic restarts every 10 minutes
- GitHub's reliable infrastructure

### Limitations:
- Requires careful implementation of session management
- GitHub may eventually restrict this usage

## Migration Strategy Between Hosting Options

If you need to move between hosting options:

1. **Backup Your Session**:
   ```bash
   tar -czf whatsapp_session_backup.tar.gz auth_info_baileys/
   ```

2. **Transfer the Backup**:
   - Use SCP: `scp whatsapp_session_backup.tar.gz user@new-server:/path/to/bot/`
   - Or use a cloud storage service temporarily

3. **Restore on New Server**:
   ```bash
   tar -xzf whatsapp_session_backup.tar.gz
   ```

4. **Update Any Environment-Specific Configurations**
