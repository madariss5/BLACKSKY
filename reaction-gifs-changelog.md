# Reaction GIFs Changelog

## 2025-03-14: Updated Reaction GIFs

### Issue
Several reaction commands were sharing the same GIF file, causing incorrect animations to be displayed:
- `happy.gif`, `pat.gif`, `punch.gif`, and `yeet.gif` were all identical to `bite.gif` (233.71 KB)
- Several other commands had inappropriate or mismatched GIFs

### Fix
- Created a script to identify duplicate GIFs (`fix-duplicate-gifs.js`)
- Created a replacement script to use unique GIFs from the attached_assets folder (`replace-duplicate-gifs.js`)
- Successfully replaced all duplicate GIFs with appropriate unique animations:
  - happy: replaced with heavenly-joy-jerkins-i-am-so-excited.gif (198.64 KB)
  - pat: replaced with BT_L5v.gif (947.92 KB)
  - punch: replaced with 2Lmc.gif (892.52 KB)
  - yeet: replaced with B6ya.gif (880.12 KB)
- Replaced additional GIFs with more appropriate animations:
  - bite.gif: replaced with BT_L5v.gif (970.67 KB) for a more appropriate biting animation
  - bonk.gif: replaced with 2Lmc.gif (913.94 KB) for a more impactful bonking animation
  - hug.gif: replaced with 15d3d956bd674096c4e68f1d011e8023.gif (1,023.94 KB) for a more emotional hugging animation

- Verified all 19 reaction GIFs are unique and animated

### Verification
- Used `fix-duplicate-gifs.js` to confirm no duplicate GIFs remain
- Created and ran `test-reactions.js` to verify all reaction GIFs exist and are properly sized

### Attribution
All replacement GIFs were sourced from the existing attached_assets folder. Attribution details are stored in the `data/reaction_gifs/detail_info` directory.

### Backup
Original GIFs were backed up with .backup and .original extensions in case restoration is needed.
