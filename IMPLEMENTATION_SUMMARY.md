## Current Limitations

### Cloud Environment Restrictions (405 Error)
- ⚠️ WhatsApp blocks connections from cloud environments like Replit
- ⚠️ This is a security measure by WhatsApp, not an issue with our code
- ⚠️ The error occurs with both QR code and pairing code methods

### Connection Stability
- ⚠️ Connections may be temporary in cloud environments
- ⚠️ Session may expire after a period of time
- ⚠️ Multiple connection attempts may be required

## Next Steps

### For Reliable Production Use
1. Follow the `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for best practices
2. Consider running the bot locally or on Heroku for better stability
3. Use pre-authenticated sessions for cloud deployments
4. Implement session backup and restore mechanisms

### Future Enhancements
1. Implement a hybrid connection approach (local authentication + cloud hosting)
2. Create a dedicated mobile app companion for easier authentication
3. Add SMS notification for connection status updates
4. Implement automatic session migration between environments

## Installation & Usage

### Quick Start
1. Choose a connection method (QR Code or Pairing Code)
2. Run the appropriate workflow
3. Follow the on-screen instructions
4. Check connection status in the logs or status dashboard
