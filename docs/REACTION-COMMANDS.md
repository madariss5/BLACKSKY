# 🎬 Fun Reaction Commands

Express yourself with animated GIFs! The WhatsApp bot includes reaction commands that let you send fun animations in your chats.

## 🤗 How to Use Reaction Commands

There are two types of reaction commands:

1. **Self-reactions** - Show your own emotions (just use the command)
   ```
   !happy
   ```

2. **Target-reactions** - React to someone else (mention them after the command)
   ```
   !hug @friendname
   ```
