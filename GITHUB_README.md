## üì± Usage

Once your bot is running, you can interact with it by sending commands in WhatsApp:

- `!help` - Display general help information
- `!menu` - Show the command menu
- `!status` - Check bot status
- `!ping` - Test bot responsiveness

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ESM)
- @whiskeysockets/baileys library
- Express.js for web dashboard
- Modular command architecture
- Advanced WebSocket connection strategies
- Dynamic authentication mechanisms
- Comprehensive error handling and logging systems

## üîÑ Two-Step Connection Process

This bot uses a special two-step process to bypass WhatsApp's restrictions on cloud platforms:

1. First authenticate on your local machine using `local-connect.js`
2. Then transfer the authentication to Heroku for 24/7 hosting

This approach provides a stable connection that doesn't disconnect frequently and works even with WhatsApp's security measures against cloud hosting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Error Recovery

The bot includes a sophisticated error recovery system:

- Exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
- Circuit breaker to prevent excessive reconnection
- Specific handlers for different disconnection reasons
- Automatic logging of connection issues for diagnostics

## üìä Status Dashboard

The bot comes with a web dashboard that shows:

- Connection status
- Uptime statistics
- Message counts
- Command usage statistics
- Recent errors
- QR code (when needed)

Access the dashboard at your Heroku app URL.
